Speedboat Alchemy is a hectic action game where your weapons are made in the middle of battle.

Jumping between keyboard and mouse controls, the player has to throw ingredients into a cauldron to make new bullets, and their properties are all randomly generated.

#### Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
- Designed and implemented a modular weapon system that could produce a variety of different effects with no additional programming, and was usable by both the player and enemies
- Designed and implemented the alchemy menu, where players frantically reload their weapon with a physics based minigame
- Implemented artificial intelligence for the gameâ€™s different enemies
- Iterated on the character controller to find a satisfying balance between the sensation of speed and the precision required for combat
