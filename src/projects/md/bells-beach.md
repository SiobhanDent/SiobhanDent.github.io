Bell’s Beach is a silly exploration platformer where fishing is taken to its illogical extreme. 

Run and jump around a vibrant coastal town, chatting with eccentric locals, and search for fishing spots that only a keen eye and a slightly mad mind will be able to discover.

Featured at Freeplay: Parallels, St. Kilda Film Fest, ACMI, and Sabby Gallery.

#### Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
- Designing and implementing a third-person character controller with a unique fishing mechanic
- Identifying inefficiencies in the team’s workflow and implementing tools/pipeline scripts to improve them, including custom asset importers, collider visualisation and a narrative scripting engine
- Planning and managing the work for an agile team of six members, facilitating communication and fostering a positive team environment that avoids crunch
- Proactively and constantly reassessing scope
- Maintaining task/issue/risk tracking and project documentation in Notion
