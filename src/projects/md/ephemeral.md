A meditative platformer about catching bugs and picking flowers while a gentle voice ushers you to the afterlife.

Inspired by the idea of a peaceful version of Hollow Knight's acrobatic combat platforming.

#### Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
- Designed and implemented a novel “bug net” mechanic which evokes the feeling of acrobatic, position-sensitive action platformer combat (e.g. Hollow Knight) while maintaining cohesion with the narrative
- Brought a complete and polished game experience from concept to completion in 48 hours, including time for playtesting
