Experience a tale as old as time: the Hero’s Journey, told as literally as possible! 

Monomyth is a relaxed and surreal walker that pokes light fun at Joseph Campbell’s universal story and the grand language used to describe it.

#### Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
- Created an interesting and thoughtful narrative experience through primarily level design
- Leveraged shaders and post-processing along with external art assets to create a cohesive art direction with little modelling or texturing work
- Produced, filmed and edited a well received 10-minute video presentation on the creation of the game and my creative process for the world’s longest running independent games festival
