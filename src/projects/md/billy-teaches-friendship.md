Billy Teaches Friendship! is a short, silly visual novel where the player helps a man and his anxious brother to overcome social anxiety and make some friends. 

It features some silly "meta" shenanigans using file manipulation, such as the game sealing itself into a password-protected zip file until you say sorry.
