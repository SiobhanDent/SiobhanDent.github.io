Billy Teaches Friendship! is a short, silly visual novel where the player helps a man and his anxious brother to overcome social anxiety and make some friends. 

It features some silly "meta" shenanigans using file manipulation, such as the game sealing itself into a password-protected zip file until you say sorry.

#### Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
- Incredibly flexible narrative game engine using a mixture of narrative scripting (Yarn Spinner) and visual scripting (Flow Canvas) to create and iterate on content quickly, smoothly, and playfully with an eye for throwaway gags.
- Experimental use of the player's operating system capabilities to convey character and comedy
